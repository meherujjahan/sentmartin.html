                <h1> St. Martine's Island</h1>
                <h2>Island in Bangladesh</h2>
                <p class="title">Millennia ago, the island used to be an extension of the Teknaf peninsula, but at a
                        later time some
                        portion of this peninsula got submerged and thus the southernmost part of the aforementioned
                        peninsula became an island, and was disconnected from the Bangladesh mainland. The first
                        settlement started 250 years ago, in 18th century, by Arabian merchants who named the island
                        'Jazira'. During British occupation the island was named after the then Deputy Commissioner of
                        Chittagong Mr. Martin as St. Martin Island. Likely because one or more of the Arabs were Saint
                        and whose name could not be identified. Local names of the island are "Narikel jinjira"[3] which
                        means 'Coconut Island', and "Daruchini Dwip" which means "Cinnamon island". It is the only coral
                        island in Bangladesh.</p>
